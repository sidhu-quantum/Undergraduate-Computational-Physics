# Undergraduate-Computational-Physics


This repository contains a structured collection of Computational Physics programs developed during my undergraduate studies in Physics.
The codes are primarily written in **C++** and focus on implementing numerical methods to solve fundamental physics and mathematical problems.


The aim of this repository is to store the code for future references.

## Contents


The repository is organized topic-wise, following the structure of a typical undergraduate Computational Physics Course.

### 1. Series Expansion
- Approximate of Euler's number (e) using Taylor/Maclaurian series
- Convergence behavior of infinite series
- Factorial-based numerical computation

(will be updated!!)

Each topic is placed in its own directory with:
- Well-commented source code
- A dedicated README explaining the physics and numerical method

## Programming Language and Tools
- **Language:** C++, Python
- **Compiler**  g++
- **Concepts used**
    - Loops and conditionals
    - Functions
    - Floating-point aritmetic
    - Numerical stability and convergence
    - (still updating...)

## Intended Audience


This repository is intended for:
- Undergraduate students learning Computational Physics
- Faculty or researchers reviewing my academic codic background
- Internship recruiters in Computational / Theoretical Physics


## Future Extensions
- Error Analysis and convergence plots
- Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions
- Implementations of PDE solvers (Heat and Wave equations)
- Python versions of selected simulations
- Visualization using plotting libraries
